## AWS Config Data Connector

> Note: we say "like" below because if you set a custom name on your AWS Config Data Connector, you'll need to replace `default` in the above snippets with that custom name.

### Event Time from Snapshot filenames

In the v1.8.2 AWS Config DC, we now collect the `event_time` from the file name of the Config snapshots in S3 and have renamed AWS's `configurationItemCaptureTime` to be collected more clearly as `configuration_item_capture_time`. Due to the significance of the changes, the only way to migrate is to re-create the collection architecture.

If you'd like to delete the Data Connector entirely you can do so a snippet like â€”

~~~
USE ROLE snowalert;
DROP PIPE data.config_default_events_pipe;
DROP STAGE data.config_default_events_stage;
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_staging;
DROP STREAM data.config_default_events_stream;
DROP TASK data.config_default_events_task;
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_connection;
~~~

And recreate the connection via the Data Connector WebUI. Note that we've also updated the landing table and prefix to include "`aws_`" at the start, so that all your AWS landing tables line up alphabetically!
