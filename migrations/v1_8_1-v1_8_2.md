## AWS Config Data Connections

> Note: we say "like" below because if you set a custom name on your AWS Config Data Connector, you'll need to replace `default` in the above snippets with that custom name.

### Event Time from Snapshot filenames

In the v1.8.2 AWS Config DC, we now collect the `event_time` from the file name of the Config snapshots in S3 and have renamed AWS's `configurationItemCaptureTime` to be collected more clearly as `configuration_item_capture_time`. Due to the significance of the changes, the only way to migrate is to re-create the collection architecture.

If you'd like to delete the Data Connector entirely you can do so a snippet like â€”

~~~
USE ROLE snowalert;
DROP PIPE data.config_default_events_pipe;
DROP STAGE data.config_default_events_stage;
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_staging;
DROP STREAM data.config_default_events_stream;
DROP TASK data.config_default_events_task;
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_connection;
~~~

And recreate the connection via the Data Connector WebUI. Note that we've also updated the landing table and prefix to include "`aws_`" at the start, so that all your AWS landing tables line up alphabetically!

## AWS CloudTrail Data Connections

Similarly to the Config Data Connector, the CloudTrail connector now has a "`aws_`" prefix and needs to be re-created if you'd like to keep it up to date. Failing to do so has no effect in version v1.8 and will be backwards compatible with future releases, but will look different than future AWS CT Data Connections.

## Azure Log Data Connections

The Azure Log data connection table will now refer correctly to the `azure_log` module. In order to update your v1.7 tables, please change the comment to include "`module: azure_log`".

## AWS Asset Ingestion now Inventory

We've renamed the `aws_asset_ingest` Data Connector to align with the others as `aws_inventory`.
