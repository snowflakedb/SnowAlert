## AWS Config Data Connector

> Note: we say "like" below because if you set a custom name on your AWS Config Data Connector, you'll need to replace `default` in the above snippets with that custom name.

### Event Time from Snapshot filenames

In the v1.8.2 AWS Config DC, we now collect the `event_time` from the file name of the Config snapshots in S3 and have renamed AWS's `configurationItemCaptureTime` to be collected more clearly as `configuration_item_capture_time`.

To keep Azure Config Connections working, please run a migration like the following on your landing table —

~~~
ALTER TABLE data.config_default_events_connection
  RENAME COLUMN event_time
             TO configuration_item_capture_time
;
ALTER TABLE data.config_default_events_connection
  ADD COLUMN event_time TIMESTAMP_LTZ(9)
;
~~~

or, if you're OK with restarting ingestion, just drop it —

~~~
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_connection;
~~~

And recreate the connection via the Data Connector WebUI.

If you'd like to delete the Data Connector entirely you can do so a snippet like —

~~~
USE ROLE snowalert;
DROP PIPE data.config_default_events_pipe;
DROP STAGE data.config_default_events_stage;
DROP TABLE data.config_default_events_staging;
DROP STREAM data.config_default_events_stream;
DROP TASK data.config_default_events_task;
~~~

### Corrected Base Name

The landing table is now named similarly to others to start with the `aws_config` prefix, matching the Python module. This change does not yet affect anything, but can be migrated by deleting and re-creating the ingestion pipeline as above and renaming the landing table with.

~~~
ALTER TABLE data.config_default_events_pipe
  RENAME TO data.aws_config_default_events_pipe;
~~~
