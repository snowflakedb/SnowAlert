## AWS Accounts Connector

In v1.8.6 the AWS Accounts DC has been adjusted so that the Account ID is represented as a string as opposed to a number. This will necessitate dropping and recreating the connector to get the correct table, which can be done with sql like the snippet below:

> Note: we say "like" below because the sql script will need the correct names of the resources; make sure that you specify the custom name for your connector, if you provided one.


### Removing the AWS Accounts Connector

~~~
DROP TABLE snowalert.data.AWS_ACCOUNTS_DEFAULT_CONNECTION;
~~~

Once the connection table is dropped, you can recreate the connector using the UI.


## Cisco Umbrella Connector

### Landing table name changed

We're renaming the table in a way that specifies that this is an inventory of roaming clients. There's no specific reaon to migrate but if you'd like to keep things tidy, please prepend `cisco_umbrella_` instead of `cisco_` to your landing tables with sql like the following:

~~~
ALTER TABLE snowalert.data.cisco_umbrella_default_connection RENAME TO snowalert.data.cisco_umbrella_devices_default_connection;
~~~
