## Adds object_assign UDTF

Please run the following code to fix a bug in the violations runner which
broke recording `query_name` in violation query results (`query_id`'s worked).

~~~
USE SCHEMA data;

CREATE FUNCTION IF NOT EXISTS object_assign (o1 VARIANT, o2 VARIANT)
RETURNS VARIANT
LANGUAGE javascript
AS '
  return Object.assign(O1, O2);
'
;
~~~
