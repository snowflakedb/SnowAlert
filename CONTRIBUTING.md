# Introduction

SnowAlert is an open source project with contributions from Snowflake's security team as well as collaborating security teams. Please reach out to us if you're interested in making SnowAlert better, we'd love to be in touch.

### Environment Variables

The installer sets up SnowAlert and gives you authentication variables for the runners and WebUI. You can run it with:

~~~
cd src/
python scripts/install.py
~~~

Once you finish, the installer will give you a command that will save env variables to a file on your local system. Since the installer is usually run from a Docker container, we opt for the explicit copy-paste so users understand exactly what they are doing. This file contains SnowAlert settings and authentication credentials and is usually referred to as an "envs file". In order to run these following commands, we assume these env vars are in the `snowalert-$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT.envs` file.

### Build, Test, and Start Runners

~~~
# to build runners
cd src/
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# to start runners
export $(cat snowalert-$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT.envs | xargs)
python runners/run.py all
~~~

If you'd like to run the test suite, please create a separate ENVS file that contains these additional variables used to test the installer:

~~~
export SA_ENV=test
export SA_ADMIN_USER=<your user>
export SA_ADMIN_USER=<your password>
~~~

If you save this to `snowalert-$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT.testing.envs`, you can run the tests with:

~~~
# test runners
export $(cat snowalert-$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT.testing.envs | xargs)
pytest -vv
~~~

### Build and Start WebUI Backend

The WebUI has two ways of authenticating. The quicker is server-side authentication accomplished by re-using the ENVS file used for runner credentials:

~~~
# where runners left off
cd src/
source .venv/bin/activate

# build backend
cd webui/backend
pip install -e .

# start backend
export $(cat snowalert-$SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT.envs | xargs)
python webui/app.py
~~~

### Building WebUI Frontend

~~~
cd src/webui/frontend
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
~~~

If you'd help authenticating the WebUI using Snowflake OAuth, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at
snowalert@snowflake.com.

## Developing a new Alert Handler

A handler is a Python module that has a `handle` function, which takes an alert and extra data to describe how it should be handled. This function uses its argument names to declare what subest of the following data it requires â€”

- `alert` - dict representation of the VARIANT in the field of the `results.alerts:ALERT` column
- `correlation_id` - the VARCHAR value in the field of the `results.alerts:CORRELATION_ID` column
- `alert_count` - the NUMBER value in the field of the `results.alerts:COUNTER` column
- `...alert['HANDLERS'][n]` - the keys and values of the alert handler being called, passed in as keyword arguments

The `handle(...)` function performs whatever is necessary for the alert to be handled. It succeeds if it returns a value and does not succeed if calling it throws an exception. Regardless, the results will be recorded in an array in the `results.alerts:HANDLED` column that is parallel to the `results.alerts:ALERT.HANDLERS` array.

For example:

- the Jira handler creates a Jira ticket or updates a correlated alert's Jira ticket. To run, it uses the `JIRA_PROJECT` env variable to know what project to use and `correlation_id` from the dispatcher. Its function declaration is thus `handle(alert: dict, correlation_id: string)`,
- the Slack handler uses the `SLACK_API` env var and an optional `channel` key/value pair from elements in the alert's `HANDLERS`, along with other variables which may be defined in Alert Queries, so its declaration starts with `handle(alert, channel=None, recipient_email=None, ...`.

Note that in the second case, the "channel" value is created dynamically by Alert Queries that use the Slack handler, and thus should have a default value in order for alert queries without that value create non-failing alerts. Failing alerts should be avoided and may be automatically retried in the future.

New handlers should be placed in the `./src/runners/handlers` directory; you should ensure that the name of the handler module is its type -- the string you will refer to it in the HANDLERS field in Alert Queries.

## Developing a new Data Connector (DC)

A Data Connector lets you use SnowAlert infrastructure to configure and run data collection into your database from sources outside of Snowflake. Contributing to the connector library allows security defenders to share the costs of data collection from their fleet, server, and cloud infrastructure.

Please get in touch with us if you're thinking of contributing a Data Connector, as these interfaces are likely to change, e.g. to have the DC framework create the landing tables and comments based on what a connector declares.

A Data Connector is a Python module in the `./src/connectors` directory and has several pieces:

### `CONNECTION_OPTIONS` (required)

This is a `List[dict]` which describe the connection options that are presented to the user when creating a connection. The key / value pairs in each dict in the list are one of:

- `name: str` (required) - the underscore-separated "machine" name that will be used to refer to the variable
- `title: str` (optional) - the human readable title that will be used when the user picks the option
- `prompt: str` (optional) - subtitle to the title clarifying what the user should enter
- `type: 'str' | 'bool'` (default "str") - the kind of value this input holds
- `options List[str]` - when present, will make UI a dropdown with the listed options
- `required: bool` - returns error to user if True, and user does not fill it in
- `postfix: str` - antd input element's  custom `addonAfter`
- `prefix: str` - antd input element's  custom `addonBefore`
- `default: str` - input element's initial value or select element's initial selection. if required, the reset value on empty input blur.
- `placeholder: str` - input element's placeholder text, or select element's un-selectable initial option
- `secret: bool` - will mask input on user's screen and `vault.encrypt` before passing it to `connect` and `vault.decrypt` before passing it to `ingest`. when landing table
- `mask_on_screen: bool`- will mask input on user's screen but not use vault to encrypt your secrets

### `LANDING_TABLE_COLUMNS` or `LANDING_TABLES_COLUMNS` (required)

There are two kinds of connectors -- those that create a single table, or those that can create one or more tables. This variable specifies either the table columns of the landing table, or the connection types and landing table columns of each type.

### `connect(connection_name, options)` (required)

This function takes the name of the connection being created as well as the options given by the user. It returns a string representing the instructions the user is to see after the first stage is complete, as well as the next stage, with the type:

~~~
type ConnectionResult = {
    newStage: 'created' | 'finalized',
    newMessage: string,
}
~~~

For now, this function *must* create a "landing table" in the `data` schema with underscore-separated values of the `connector_name`, `connection_name`, `connection_type`, and the string `"connection"`, e.g. `azure_uswest_audit_connection`. In the case that a connector creates one and only one kind of table, you may skip the `connection_type`, e.g. `okta_snowflake_connection`. In the case that your organization expects only one connection of a type, you should leave that connection named `default`, e.g. `cloudtrail_default_connection`. Your function must grant SELECT and INSERT on this table to the SnowAlert runner role.

### `finalize(connection_name)` (optional)

If a Connector (e.g. the CloudTrail connector) requires the user to take some action before completing the connection, the Connector module author can include a "finalize" step to allow the user to do so.

### `ingest(connection_name, options)` (optional)

If a Connection requires regular ingestion via a Scheduled Task, you can do so using this method. It sould return a string, a `GeneratorType[number]`, or a number.

### `test(connection_name)` (optional)

> note: this is describing functionality which didn't get released. include it if you would like to be future-supportive.

If a Connector would like to present this user with an option to test the connection, you can do so here. Must return `GeneratorType[dict]` with items of type

~~~
type TestResult = {
    success: bool,
    description: string,
}
~~~
