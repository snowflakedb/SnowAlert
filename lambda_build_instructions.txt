1. install docker for mac
    https://www.docker.com/docker-mac

2. Run the following command:
    `docker run -it lambci/lambda:build-python3.6 bash`

   What that does is drop you into a bash shell inside a docker environment that mirrors what lambda's execution environment for python 3.6 is.

3. Copy your .py file over to the docker container
    `docker cp /path/to/file <containerID>:/path/to/target`

    You can get the container id by running `docker ps` on the host.

4. Copy the package-lambda-function.sh file over to the docker container as well
    You'll want to check line 15 of that file, because right now it's hard-coded to zip`lambda_function.py` into the deployment package and that won't help you unless that's what your python file is called.

5. On the docker machine, run that shell script. 

6. Copy the newly produced .zip file back to your host

7. Upload the zip to lambda, invoke your function, and note that you have successfully imported the snowflake connector.
