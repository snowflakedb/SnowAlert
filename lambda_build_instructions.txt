1. install docker for mac
    https://www.docker.com/docker-mac

2. Run the following command:
    `docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/var/task lambci/lambda:build-python3.6 bash`

    That command starts an interactive (-it) docker container that mirrors the execution environment of the lambda function. Additionally, it has a bind mount of your current working direcotry in /var/task, the directory that you will get dropped into in the container.

3. On the docker container, run `/scripts/package-lambda-deployment.sh`. This is a shell script which takes in the python files you want to package, spins up a virtual environment for python 3.6, pip installs the python-connector, and packages it all together. It outputs file.zip, where file is the name of the first python file you passed in as an argument.  

4. Upload the zip to Lambda either through S3 or through the console, invoke your function, and note that you have successfully imported the Snowflake connector.
